# Canvas Style by Domain
This JavaScript and CSS allow you to detect the domain used to access Canvas and then apply CSS based on the domain.

## Usage
* Add list of domains used to access Canvas (usually DNS CNAME records) to the switch in style_by_domain.js
* Set preferred class to be appended to body when a domain is detected
* Add CSS rules using the added domain class selector to canvas-style-by-domain.css
* Upload style_by_domain.js and style_by_domain.css to the Theme Editor.
